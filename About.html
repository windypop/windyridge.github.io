<p>The cottage is accessed from the lane, just 200 yards from Wern Road. </p>
<p>The lane is shared, but the traffic is very light. This is a very quiet spot so you shouldn't be disturbed, however the sheep are inquisitive and may visit you, but they are easily shooed away. You may see new born lambs on the moor from April to June.</p>
<p>There is parking for two or three cars. </p>

<p>The cottage has a concrete entrance with stoned area behind, it is largely level so wheelchair access is not an issue. There is a wide step up to the cottage French doors, but a ramp can be provided if required.</p>
<p>There is also a low-ish door threshold into the Kitchen/Lounge, which is easily managed with a wheelchair or buggy.</p>

<p>The accommodation is all on one floor and comprises a kitchen/diner/lounge, a double bedroom, a twin bunk bedroom and a shower room.</p>
<p>All rooms have radiators and the heating is provided by an air source heat pump.
There is no phone, but mobile reception is quite good on most networks.</p>
<p>The kitchen/diner area is well served with an oven, microwave, induction hob, toaster, kettle, sink and fridge.</p>
<p>There is a radio for those morning programmes which may have become part of your life, and impossible to live without.</p>
<p>There are pots and pans, cutlery, crockery and glassware for your use.</p>
<p>The dining table and four dining chairs are easily packed away after use, if required.</p>
<p>The cottage is a no smoking area throughout. </p>

<p>The lounge area offers a two seater and two single chairs, each of which can be opened to form comfortable beds, if needed. Bedding can be provided for these at a small charge, but if you wish to use sleeping bags on the chair/beds then there is no extra cost.</p>
<p>There is a facility for playing and watching DVDs, for entertainment on those (hopefully few) occasions when its wet!</p>
<p>To keep in touch with your emails and social networking, free wifi is available.
Generally mobile reception is OK.</p>
<p>The west facing picture window gives great views towards Moel Arthur.</p>

<p>On the South side of the cottage is a sitting area, with great views to Moel Famau, Horseshoe Pass, Hope Mountain and Mold - especially good for just taking in the whole landscape, and enjoying the warmth of the sun.</p>

<p>You can get to the open moorland just by stepping through the gateway, it extends for many miles over Halkyn Mountain, and although it can be wet or boggy in areas, is home to many birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Well behaved dogs are welcome at the cottage, but an additional deposit will be required to cover any extra cleaning which may be required at the end of your stay.</p>
<p>On the mountain, and throughout all common land areas, dogs must be kept on a lead at all times, to avoid them worrying the sheep, particularly when pregnant or with young lambs. It’s not that the dogs necessarily chase the sheep, but just the sight of a dog running is sometimes enough to frighten a ewe into panicking, mis-carrying or leaving her lambs.
For this reason also there is a 40 mph speed limit on many of the roads on the Common.</p>
